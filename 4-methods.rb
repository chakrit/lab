# How to `greet`?
#
# We need a `name` and a `year_born` to greet someone!
# `name` and `year_born` are INPUTs (aka ARGUMENTs or PARAMETERs)
  def greet(name, year_born)
#  ðŸ¢‘    ðŸ¢‘  ðŸ¢‘
#  |    |  î¬¶
#  |    |   î¬¯â”€ the () brackets specifies the INPUT variables
#  |    î¬¶
#  |     î¬¯â”€ methods, just like variables, needs a name
#  î¬¶
#   î¬¯â”€ `def` starts a method "definition"

    # The method content are put between `def` and `end`
    puts("Greetings #{name}! You were born in #{year_born}")
    puts("It is nice to meet you!")

  end
# ðŸ‘† This says, we're done with the greeting instructions

# ðŸ‘‡ now let's call the method and see what happens
